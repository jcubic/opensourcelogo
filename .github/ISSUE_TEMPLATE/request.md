## I need logo for my Open Source project

<!--

Please write something about your project and include the link to the website
if you have one and to your source code reposity (GitHub/BitBucket/GitLab etc.)

If you don't have website you should start creating one, you can use GitHub pages
if you use GitHub.

The project need to have some stars and good name. I know, it's hard to find
right name, but it's also hard to create logo for project with bad name.
