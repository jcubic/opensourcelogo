## Open Source Logo

I'm offering a free service of designing a logo for your Open Source project.
 
Requirement is that it needs to have some users (some download counts or github stars).
Best if the project has a website even if it's just a Github pages one.

## License

Designed logos will have license:

[CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)

The website that will use the logo will need to put proper attribution:

Logo by [Jakub T. Jankiewicz](https://jcubic.pl) licensed with
[CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)

The link to my website can't have `rel="nofollow"` attribute.
